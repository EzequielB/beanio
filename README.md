BeanIO
======

A Java library for marshalling and unmarshalling bean objects from XML, CSV, delimited and fixed length stream formats.

**Note:**

This is a fork of the original BeanIO library. It combines :

* the legacy SVN codebase that was hosted at https://code.google.com/p/beanio/
* "the future BeanIO 3.x" that was started at https://github.com/kevinseim/beanio
* several fixes from other forks (see commit messages for more info)
 
The website for version 2.x is available at http://www.beanio.org.
